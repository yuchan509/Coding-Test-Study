''''
The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.

For example, consider array A such that:
    
  A = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

  A[0] = 0
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 1

    - 0 represents a car traveling east, --> P : 0 
    - 1 represents a car traveling west. --> Q : 0

We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).
